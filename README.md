# Testing
This project provides a series of JavaScript functions that manipulate and analyze an array of movie objects. Each function addresses a specific task, using various JavaScript methods to filter, map, and reduce the data. Here's a brief overview of the methods and strategies used to solve the exercises:

* Mapping: The map() function is used to transform arrays, such as extracting specific properties (e.g., director names or movie titles) from the movie objects.

* Filtering: The filter() method is employed to select subsets of the data based on criteria, like movies directed by a specific director or belonging to a certain genre.

* Sorting: Several exercises require sorting movies by different criteria, such as titles or release years. The sort() method is used to reorder movies either alphabetically or numerically.

* Reducing: To compute aggregates, such as averages or the best movie in a year, the reduce() method is applied. This helps in accumulating values, like summing up scores.

* Regex and String Manipulation: In exercises involving durations, regular expressions and string methods are used to convert time formats (e.g., hours and minutes) into a uniform numerical value.

* These functions provide a foundational approach to working with arrays and objects in JavaScript, emphasizing key data transformation techniques essential for solving real-world problems.
